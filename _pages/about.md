Hello!

I am currently a mathematics PhD student at [UC Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/).
My research is in the intersection of algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
My advisor is [Patricio Gallardo](https://sites.google.com/site/patriciogallardomath/) and my thesis is on compact moduli spaces of marked plane curves.

Dear github, please build this site for me

<!-- You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
