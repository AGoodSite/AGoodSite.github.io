Since 2021 I have been conducting research in algebraic geometry. Before then I was primarily interested in category theory.

My thesis research is on compact moduli spaces of curves. Essentially this is an answer to the question ``what are all the one dimensional shapes that exist?'' To interpret this question mathematically we must make it more precise. We get a wealth of different answers depending on *how* we make the question more precise.

Algebraic geometers are interested in spaces which are the solutions to polynomial equations. For instance, a circle is the set of points $$ (x,y) $$ which are solutions to the quadratic equation $$ x^2 + y^2 = 25 $$. We say that a circle is an algebraic curve. It is a plane curve of degree $$ 2 $$ because it is the zero set of the **quadratic** polynomial $$ x^2 + y^2 - 25 $$.
