At UC Riverside I have taught approximately 50 courses as a Teaching Assistant and as a primary instructor.
I have also mentored undergraduate students through reading groups and research projects.
I attend teaching workshops and seminars to improve my teaching, which to me is a lifelong goal. This is just the beginning.

<h1> Courses Taught: </h1>

<h2> As a primary instructor </h2>

- Math 10b - Vector Calculus - Summer 2022 <br>
    I utilized ed-tech to give students computational tools for visualizing mathematical objects in two and three dimensions and also to make lectures available to students remotely.
- Math 153 - Set Theory -Summer 2024 <br>
    This course developed students' skills in formal logic and proof-writing through iterative feedback. I implemented Universal Design for Learning guidelines by offering multiple options for the final assessment, allowing students' diverse learning styles to flourish.
