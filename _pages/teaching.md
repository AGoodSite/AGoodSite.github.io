At UC Riverside I have taught approximately 50 courses as a Teaching Assistant and as a primary instructor.
I have also mentored undergraduate students through reading groups and research projects.
I attend teaching workshops and seminars to improve my teaching, which to me is a lifelong goal. This is just the beginning.


<h2> Pedagogical training </h2>

- Certification - Art and Science of Healthy Pedagogy XCITE, Spring 2024.
    
This workshop trained us in strategies for fostering caring, creative, and inclusive classroom environments, with sessions on accessible education technology, Culturally Responsive Teaching, and Trauma-Aware Teaching.

- Pedagogy Workshops - 
    
XCITE Information Literacy Assesment, Teaching Week Fall 2024
    
Student Disability Resource Center, Disability Ally Workshop, Fall 2024
    
Academy of Distinguished Teaching Workshop: Creating Assignments and Exams that Foster Learning and Growth, Fall 2024


- UCR Diversity Seminar - Fall 2020, Winter 2022.

We discuss evidence-based strategies for developing a culture of inclusivity and equity within the mathematical community.

- Education Seminar - Winter 2021, Winter 2025. 
    
We discuss literature and research on mathematical education and teaching practices.
  

<h2> Mentorship </h2>
- Reading Courses - Led courses on algebraic geometry, category theory, and sheaf theory; collaborated on a senior thesis project.
    
We worked on reading the first two chapters of Vakil's lecture notes on algebraic geometry. Both of the undergraduate students transitioned to graduate programs in mathematics.

- Research Project - Led Math 197 project on Newton Polytopes of plane curves, Spring 2024.
    
The students studied combinatorial aspects of algebraic geometry. They presented their work to the faculty and their peers. 

<h2> Professional service </h2>

<h1> Courses Taught: </h1>

<h2> As a primary instructor </h2>

- Math 10b - Vector Calculus - Summer 2022 <br>
  I utilized ed-tech to give students computational tools for visualizing mathematical objects in two and three dimensions and also to make lectures available to students remotely.
- Math 153 - Set Theory -Summer 2024 <br>
  This course developed students' skills in formal logic and proof-writing through iterative feedback. I implemented Universal Design for Learning guidelines by offering multiple options for the final assessment, allowing students' diverse learning styles to flourish.
